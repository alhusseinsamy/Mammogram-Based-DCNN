# Mammogram based cancer detection using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. 
  The INbreast dataset is used to build a DCNN from scratch using keras. The DCNN takes as input the mammogram, breast mass ROI, and microcalcification ROI and outputs a classification as either benign or malignant. The ROIs are input to the DCNN as masked images. Please contact husseinsamy32@gmail.com for the mammogram and ROI files.
